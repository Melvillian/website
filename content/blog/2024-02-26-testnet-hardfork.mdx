Iron Fish is preparing for its first hardfork. The first hardfork will include [FIP-2](https://fips.ironfish.network/fips/fip-2-enforce-sequential-block-time), [FIP-3](https://fips.ironfish.network/fips/fip-3-memory-hard-mining-algorithm), [FIP-8](https://fips.ironfish.network/fips/fip-8-difficulty-adjustment), [FIP-9](https://fips.ironfish.network/fips/fip-9-swap-randomness-and-graffiti). 

The most notable change is the hashing algorithm switch from blake3 to FishHash. To read more about FishHash, the motivation behind finding a new hashing algorithm for Iron Fish, as well as exploration of other algorithm choices, please see [FIP-3](https://fips.ironfish.network/fips/fip-3-memory-hard-mining-algorithm) (or community created video walkthroughs like this [one](https://youtu.be/1R7VffTzM9g?si=U0PhustQsp8TG9ak)). 

Logistically, the timeline for the mainnet hardfork is as follows: 

- Feb 20th: Release of the Iron Fish node version that includes Testnet hardfork activation ([release notes and binaries](https://github.com/iron-fish/ironfish/releases/tag/v1.20.0))
- Feb 28th: Testnet hardfork activation at block sequence 419,193 on the Iron Fish¬†[Testnet](https://testnet.explorer.ironfish.network/), estimated February 28 2024 17:00 GMT
- March 6th: Release of the Iron Fish node version that includes Mainnet hardfork activation
- April 2nd: Mainnet hardfork activation at block sequence 503,338 on the Iron Fish¬†[Mainnet](https://explorer.ironfish.network/), estimated April 2 2024 13:00 GMT

### Why you should participate in the Iron Fish Testnet leading up to the Mainnet Hardfork

The biggest reason you should participate is that it‚Äôll get you ready to keep mining Iron Fish on mainnet post the algorithm switch. FishHash is designed to be more memory hard which means it‚Äôll require at least 5GB of memory and produce less hashes per second on comparable hardware than the existing blake3 algorithm. 

Between now and Mainnet hardfork activation in April, the Iron Fish Foundation and IF Labs team is acutely dedicated to helping mining pools and mining software providers migrate to FishHash. Please note that as part of this hardfork there are other changes that are going in that will slightly change the format of the Block Header, so *just* switching from blake3 to FishHash is not sufficient. The change that‚Äôs going in that‚Äôll change Block Header format is [FIP-9](https://fips.ironfish.network/fips/fip-9-swap-randomness-and-graffiti) that swaps the `randomness` and `graffiti` field.
