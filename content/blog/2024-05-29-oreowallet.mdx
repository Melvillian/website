In this spotlight, we're thrilled to be talking to long-time community member and contributor Fishguy.

Fishguy is the creator of [OreoWallet](https://oreowallet.com/)—a browser extension wallet for Iron Fish, and a project that was approved for an ongoing grant from the Iron Fish Foundation.

We asked Fishguy how he got his start in engineering, what attracted him to crypto, and what inspired him to build OreoWallet. Let's dive in!

#### What is OreoWallet?

OreoWallet is a self-custody browser extension wallet that allows you to receive, hold and send assets (including but not limited to IRON) in the Iron Fish blockchain system—without the need of running your own node.

#### What makes OreoWallet unique?

OreoWallet is the first browser extension wallet for Iron Fish aiming to provide the best user experience.

#### What inspired you to create OreoWallet?

Browser extension wallets are the most popular types of wallets, and they have benefits for the upcoming Iron Fish bridge applications. OreoWallet can be used for those assets as well.

The Node App also takes a long time to sync from scratch with limited resources, coupled with the single threaded nature of Node.js tech stack. OreoWallet wants to provide a better user experience.

#### How did you get started with engineering?

I majored in communications engineering during my undergraduate and graduate studies. So, I have already started in university. Then I joined crypto and met some amazing projects like Iron Fish.

#### How did that path lead you to crypto?

We are so used to keeping our money in an organization backed by a centralized team. However, we never know who truly controls our money or if they are smarter than us. I want to keep my money in my hands—we all should.

I realized Bitcoin is cool because we can manage and control our money in a decentralized manner. Iron Fish is cool as it utilizes zero-knowledge stack. ZKPs allow users to transact privately in a permissionless way. Simply amazing!

#### What is the ethos of crypto and privacy that led you to be a part of Iron Fish?

“Not your key, not your crypto.” “Never trust, always verify.”

#### Do you have a favorite programming language?

Although JavaScript is widely recognized as the most powerful language in blockchain and is incredibly easy to use, I personally prefer using Rust now.

#### How long have you been in the Iron Fish community?

I have been a part of the Iron Fish community for three years, since 2021.

#### Is there anything you would like to see in the wider crypto space?

Massive adoption of blockchain technology.

#### What else would you like to share about yourself with the Iron Fish community?

Personally, as a developer, I am constantly contemplating what constitutes an excellent product. My experiences in the crypto space, especially with Pendle, have taught me that a superior product is one that truly meets the users' and market's needs. This understanding is what has kept me in the Iron Fish community for such a long time resulting in OreoWallet.

We want to deeply thank Fishguy and everyone who contributed to OreoWallet — you have been an incredible part of the Iron Fish community continuously building tools to elevate user experience. OreoWallet is an incredibly important feature in the Iron Fish ecosystem and is pivotal to completing the user flow of storing wrapped private assets directly in a web browser.
