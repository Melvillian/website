The string is typically generated by the [`exportAccount` RPC](/developers/documentation/rpc/wallet/export_account), although the string can be [manually generated with the sdk](https://github.com/iron-fish/ironfish/blob/master/ironfish/src/wallet/account/encoder/account.ts).

This endpoint also supports structured input. 

The optional `createdAt` field can be used to set the block sequence to start scanning from for the imported account. Note that, if the account received any transactions on a block before this sequence, then those transactions will *not* appear in the account's balance.

{
  account: RpcAccountImport | string
